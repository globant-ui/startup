            <p>
                The early history of the automobile can be divided into a number of eras, based on the prevalent means of propulsion. Later periods were defined by trends in exterior styling, size, and utility preferences.
                In 1769 the first steam-powered automobile capable of human transportation was built by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot.
