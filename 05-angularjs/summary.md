* App doesn't work. :-(
* App use bower, but bower.json was not include in the project.
* Why did you use bower for angular.js and angular-route.js, but not for jquery-2.1.4.js and ngStorage.js ?
* HTML5 would be nice to have.
* Html layout is not good. Tags are not selected well.
* Bad implementation of bootstrap.
* Topic ask specifically for 2 controllers.
* Add and modify could share the same html.
